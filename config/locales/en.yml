    title: How to use the Blue Forest Mapping Tool
    intro: One of the key features of the Blue Forest Mapping Tool is the ability to easily obtain the amount of carbon stored in coastal habitats. These steps below show you have to use this feature.
    bullets:
      - 
        "To begin from the homepage, simply click ‘Start using the tool’.  You then have a choice of countries to select from.<br><br>
        Alternatively, once you have begun using the tool you can switch between countries by selecting them from the navigation menu. The current country you are viewing is indicated along with the appropriate country flag."
      - 
        "Once the country map has loaded, you can focus on areas where blue carbon habitat has been recorded using the scroll or zoom buttons.
        <br><br>
        You will see the study sites that were part of the GEF Blue Forests Project listed on the side. Hovering over the study sites with your mouse will reveal their location on the map."
      - 
        "Hovering over field site names to show that they appear on the map. You can scroll and zoom on map to view different areas in more detail."
      - 
        "To define the area that you are interested in you can draw a polygon over an area of habitat directly onto the map.
        <br><br>
        Simply click the ‘draw a polygon’ button.
        <br><br>
        Then, click the first point you wish to place on the map. Then draw the outline of your area of interest with as many points as required. Once you are happy with the shape, click on the first point again to close the polygon. Once this is closed, carbon calculations will begin automatically.
        <br><br>
        The tool retrieves information relating to the amount of carbon stored in the selected area – both as a total value and broken down by habitat. The tool also provides you with information about the spatial extent of the specific area."
      -
        If you wish to define a new area, simply click the ‘+ button at the top right-hand side and repeat the same process. You can create up to 3 different areas of drawn polygons and related calculations

    paragraphs:
      - 
        The Blue Forests Mapping Tool uses the following Methodology to carbon stored in marine and coastal habitats.
      - 
        In order to calculate the quantity of blue carbon in each site we have used the most recent, globally consistent estimates of blue carbon storage per unit area (Table 1 below) multiplied this by the area of each of the habitats in the selected areas.
      - 
        The analysis is restricted to the quantity of carbon stored within the first metre of soil due to the availability of data. As such, the final values likely represent a conservative estimate of the total carbon found.
      - 
        Furthermore, the limited availability of data means that the analysis does not capture spatial variability in carbon estimates between sites and geographies.
